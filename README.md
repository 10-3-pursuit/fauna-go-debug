There are at least 9 mistakes in the code. Use `npm run create coyote` to continually test the code. Read the errors in the terminal and fix the code in each file.

**\*\*NOTE:** There are not mistakes in the `package.json` file nor in the `data` folder. so don't look in there. All mistakes are in the `src` folder or in the `index.js` file.

Good Luck!
