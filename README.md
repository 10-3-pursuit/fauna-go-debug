# DEBUG

There are at least 10 mistakes in the code.

Each Squad will make a list of as many bugs as they found.
e.g.

1. There was a typo in the word `function`

Use the `npm run create coyote` command in your terminal to continually test the code. Debug by reading the errors in the terminal and fix the code in each file. Each error usually contains a filename and a line number. After you correct one error, run the command again. The sign of success is that you receive a different error when you run the command until you are out of errors.

**\*\*NOTE:** There are no mistakes in the `package.json` file nor in the `data` folder. So don't look in there!

All mistakes are in the `src` folder or in the `index.js` file.

Good Luck!
